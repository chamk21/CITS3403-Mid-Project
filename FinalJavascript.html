        <h1>Evolution</h1>
        <p>
            In 1995, the National Centre of Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) released a browser called NCSA Mosaic. This was a very popular browser at the time. To challenge the NCSA Mosaic, Marcreessen brought in a majority of the developers who built NCSA Mosaic
            to a company called Netscape. They built a competing browser called Netscape communicator.
        </p>

        <p>
            However both browsers lacked a primary programming language. Marcressen believed the web needed a dynamic object model and needed much more automation as to allow interaction. To develop a scripting language, Netscape entered into a partnership with Sun’s
            Microsystems who were the owners of Java. Java was starting to gain fame for its features. So the Netscape/Sun partnership meant Sun acquired the use of a competitive browser and a delivery system for their strategic technology.

        <p>
            Breindan Eich who was on the team at Netscape decided to build a working prototype of Javascript. This was called Netscape’s Mocha at first and later changed to javascript. JavaScript was later integrated in their web-browser. JavaScript was born to be
            a small client side scripting language. It was different to java in that Java was too big and targeted at large corporations. Javascript was for dynamic web with interactions. Furthermore javacsript scripting was small and easy to use by beginners.
            It was designed to turn the web into a full-blown application platform. Furthermore it was designed to work in companion with Java. Hence this is why Netscape needed the partnership with Java. Many people believe because the 2 names sound
            similiar ,they are very same but its quite the opposite.
        </p>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            JavaScript is most commonly used as a client side scripting language. A client-side script is a programming language that executes its functions exclusively on the computer of the client, and does not have to communicate with the server to operate. For
            example, if a web page is loaded on your computer and your Internet drops, you can still communicate with the already loaded web pages on your browser.
        </p>
        <p>
            JavaScript needs to be written into the HTML page because the HTML,CSS and JavaScript all get executed together . Javascript techniques allow for highly responsive interfaces to be created. It also allows for dynamic functionality. This meaning the user
            doesn’t have to wait for the server to react to show another page. JavaScript can load content into the document if and when the user needs it, without reloading the entire page — this is commonly referred to as Ajax. Javascript is mainly
            used for front end to “spice up” the website. Angular JS, React.js and jQuery are mainly front end frameworks and libraries. However Node.js is backend is used to add functionality.

        <p>Ajax allows us to make requests asynchronously in the background without having to reload and refresh whole page. If we want to update a small section of page we can utilize ajax without having to reload page. We first make a JavaScript call to
            an ajax engine. From the AJAX engine it sends a XMLHttpRequest to server. Then we receive data in JSON/XML and we do whatever we want. </p>
