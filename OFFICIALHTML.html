        <h1>History and evolution of Hypertext Markup Language</h1>
        <h2>Birth of HTML</h2>
        <p>
            The birth of HTML(Hypertext Mark-up Language) was in thanks to Timothy John Berners-Lee. He came up with the idea in 1991 when working at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN">CERN</a> in Geneva. He initially proposed the idea of HTML
            tags in a document and he proposed how these could be used to make custom web pages. The concepts behind HTML weren’t all brand new. Many of the concepts for HTML were adopted from
            <a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/SGML-Standard-Generalized-Markup-Language">SGML</a>(Standardised generalized mark-up language). At the time SGML was for specialists who were experienced professionals. Custom web pages were
            unheard of and Tim wanted to change that.

        <h2>Evolution</h2>
        <p>
            June 1993, HTML 1.2 was release. It had more than 40 tags but most of them were core basic tags used as of today.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1994 Tim founded the foundation of W3C. The word wide web Consortium. Its mission was to “To lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing protocols and guidelines that ensure the long-term growth of the Web.” The purpose of W3C is to
            maintain standards and protocol in order to see HTML thrive in the future. It is essentially a governing body that makes sure everything associated with HTML is looked over and controlled.
        </p>
        <p>
            HTML kept evolving till HTML 4.01 which was released in December 24,1999. This was a very stable version and web developers used this for more than 10 years.
        </p>
        <p>
            After HTML 4.01 , a newer version came out called XHTML. It stood for extensible Hypertext Markup Language. It is similar to HTML 4.01 but utilizes more strict XML-based syntax. XHTML was used heavily until HTML 5 came out.
        </p>
        <p>
            XHTML had strict standards. Web developers were required to follow strict rules of XML. A stricter mark-up language upon which the W3C was basing most of their technologies. Tighter standards encouraged developers to use a single writing style. This also
            created unity in the developers community as everybody had similar skills.

        </figure>
        <p>
            The above site was the first ever site created by Tim. It utilised core tags from HTML 1.2. Many of the tags from HTML1.2 are utilized as of today and even on this very site.The table down below demonstrates the core tags that are used on this site and
            their evolution throughout. The navbar of the left side of this site utilizes lists, however CSS was added to give it a more aesthetic feature. The site also utilizes the headings ,paragraphs and anchor tags to display information. A new feature
            which wasn’t in HTML 1.2 was tables and javascript.
